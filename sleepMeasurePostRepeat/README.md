# sleep, measure, post, repeat #

This sketch reads the ambient temperature, humidity and differential pressure, prints them to serial output, posts them online and then goes to sleep.
The values measured are posted on ThingSpeak through MQTT.
Temperature and humidity can be read from two different sensors.
